// Kotlin can be easily mixed with Java code. Default collections in Kotlin are all Java collections under the hood. There are both read-only and mutable collections.
// The Kotlin standard library contains lots of extension functions that make working with collections more convenient. 
// For example, operations that transform a collection into another one, starting with 'to': toSet or toList.
// Implement the extension function Shop.getSetOfCustomers(). The class Shop and all related classes are given.
